## Update

I can't in good faith recommend Gatsby at this point in time. Thankfully there are lots of better options. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a great bet.

I will do my best to maintain my "current recommendations" on [init.tips](https://init.tips).

I am archiving this repo now.

### Minimal Gatsby Typescript Starter (with some opinions)

This is my minimal starter for Gatsby+Typescript web apps. I use this combo a lot so I boiled down the essentials into one package.
[t3.gg](https://t3.gg), my personal site, is powered with this template.

More info to come on each package included and why it was included

#### Getting started

`yarn install` and `gatsby develop` away
